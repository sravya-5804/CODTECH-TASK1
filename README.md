## Overview of the Project
## Project: Implementing linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
## Objective:
The Objective of this project is top implement a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms and location. We performed this on fetch_california_housing dataset
## Key Activities:
**Loading and Exploring Data:** Fetching the California Housing dataset using fetch_california_housing() and converting it into a pandas DataFrame. This involves understanding the structure of the dataset and its features.
**Data Preparation:** Selecting relevant features ('MedInc', 'HouseAge', 'AveRooms') for predicting housing prices ('PRICE'). This step includes setting up the input (X) and output (y) variables.
**Model Building:** Creating a Linear Regression model (LinearRegression() from scikit-learn) and training it using the training data (X_train, y_train). This step involves fitting the model to learn patterns in the data.
**Model Evaluation:** Making predictions (y_pred) on the test data (X_test) and evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (mean_squared_error, r2_score from scikit-learn). This step helps assess how well the model predicts housing prices.
**Visualization:** Plotting the predicted versus actual housing prices (plt.scatter()) and visualizing the model's performance. Additionally, displaying feature importance (coefficients) to understand which features contribute most to predicting housing prices.
## Technologies used:
**Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis
**Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
**matplotlib:** Employed for creating static, animated and interactive visualization.
**seaborn:** Used for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.
